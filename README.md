# Combat Draft

## About

The armor system in Rimworld is very difficult to use. If you want colonists to wear protective equipment, you will suffer a permanent speed penalty due to it's bulk, but equipping it before combat requires careful micromanagement to ensure everyone equips everything before being drafted. Assigning different outfits in the Assign tab is difficult because pawns will automatically return to work once equipped, so you need to watch and draft them manually when they finish getting changed.

This mod adds a gizmo which, when clicked, will make the selected pawns equip combat gear and then go to the location specified. When they are undrafted, they will re-equip their previous outfit. This works by temporarily switching their assigned outfit (similar to the Assign tab) while drafting them.

By default, pawns will switch to the Soldier outfit (configurable in mod settings), meaning they will equip combat armor, helmets etc, but a custom outfit can also be selected per pawn by using the right click menu. Want someone to fight naked alongside their armored comrades? Just select the nudist outfit for them and they will undress when using combat draft, then get dressed again once undrafted.

If you want a colonist to use specific gear, you will need to create a special outfit for them, which can be done in the Assign tab, then tell Combat Draft to assign it to them using the right-click menu of the Combat Draft gizmo.

The original Draft gizmo is still available alongside Combat Draft and works exactly how it does normally. It does not change equipment or move anyone, it simply drafts the selected pawns immediately. This is very useful for doing quick actions (for arresting a mentally broken colonist, for instance) without taking the time to change outfits.

This mod is very similar to the well-known [Gear up and Go](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1316142788), and is inspired by it, but it works very differently.

This mod does not require [Better Pawn Control](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1541460369), and does not interact with that mod in any way. Instead, it relies on the vanilla game's outfit system.

I originally made this for myself because I do not use Better Pawn Control and wanted similar functionality to Gear Up And Go without the need to install additional mods or set outfits manually each time I draft colonists. I figured it might be useful, so I decided to polish it up and release it.

Because this uses the vanilla outfit system, it works exactly the same way as the Assign tab. Your colonists will equip any valid items for their outfit that are available in any stockpile in exactly the same way they would if you changed their outfit using the Assign tab. They will not equip items which are forbidden or which aren't in a stockpile zone or on a shelf.

Please keep in mind this is my first mod. It's likely to have bugs/issues.
